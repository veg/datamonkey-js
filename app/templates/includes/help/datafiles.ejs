  <h3>General Remarks</h3>
  
  <p>
  To perform a selection analysis, datamonkey.org needs a multiple alignment of at
  least three homologous coding nucleotide sequences.  Codon based methods for
  estimating dN and dS can be applied to any sequence alignment, but there are
  several considerations to keep in mind:
  </p>

  <p>
  Ideally, the alignment should represent a single gene, or protein product,
  sampled over multiple taxa (e.g. mammalian interferon genes), or a diverse
  population sample (e.g. Influenza A viruses infecting different individuals).
  Because comparative methods estimate relative rates of synonymous and
  non-synonymous substitution, substantial sequence diversity is needed for
  reliable inference. For example when, Suzuki and Nei applied a REL-type method
  to a very low divergence (1 or 2 substitutions per sequence along a star
  phylogeny) sample of the Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), they found that the
  method performed poorly. Yang and colleagues have suggested that the total
  length of the phylogenetic tree should be at least one expected substitution per
  codon site, but it is impossible to give a generally valid range for desirable
  sequence divergence. However, sequences that are too divergent could lead to
  saturation, i.e. our inability to reliably infer branch lengths and substitution
  parameters.  The number of sequences in the alignment is important: too few
  sequences will contain too little information for meaningful inference, while
  too many may take too long to run. At the time of this writing, Datamonkey
  permits up to 150 sequences for SLAC analyses, 100 for FEL/IFEL analyses, 40 for
  REL and PARRIS and 25 for GA-Branch. As a rule of thumb, at least 10 sequences
  are needed to detect selection at a single site (SLAC/FEL/IFEL/REL) with any
  degree of reliability, while as few as 4 may be sufficient for alignment-wide
  inference (PARRIS/GA-Branch). The median number of sequences in an alignment
  submitted to Datamonkey is 19.  Comparative methods are ill suited to study
  certain kinds of selection. For example, they should not be applied to the
  detection of selective sweeps (rapid replacement of one allele with a more fit
  one, resulting in a homogeneous population), unless sequences sampled prior to
  and following the selective sweep are included in the sample. A number of
  publications have dealt with this issue extensively (e.g. Selection using
  HyPhy), and we refer an interested reader to one of these works for further
  insight.
  </p>

  <p>
  It is a good practice to visually inspect your data to make sure that the
  sequences are alignment correctly. Of course, one can never be sure that an
  alignment is objectively correct, but gross misalignments (e.g. sequences that
  are out of frame) are easy to spot with software that provides a graphical
  visualization of the alignment, such as HyPhy, Se-Al, or BioEdit. Datamonkey
  uses the HyPhy package as its processing engine, and if an alignment does not
  open in HyPhy on your machine (using the File:Open:Open Data File command), then
  it will not be properly read by Datamonkey.
  </p>

  <p>
  You should verify that the alignment is in frame, i.e. that it does not contain
  stop codons, including premature stop codons (indicative of a frame shift, e.g.
  due to misalignment, or a non-functional coding sequence) and the terminal stop
  codon. Your alignment should exclude any non-coding region of the nucleotide
  sequence, such as introns or promoter regions, for which existing models of
  codon substitution would not apply. When coding nucleotide sequences are aligned
  directly, frameshifting (i.e. not in multiples of 3) gaps may be inserted, since
  the alignment program often does not take the coding nature of the sequence into
  account. Therefore it is generally a good idea to align translated protein
  sequences and then map them back onto constituent nucleotides. Datamonkey will
  perform a number of checks when it receives coding sequences and report all
  problems it encounters.
  </p>

  <p>
  If the alignment contains identical sequences, Datamonkey will discard all but
  one copy before proceeding. This is done to speed up the analyses, because
  identical sequences do not contribute any information to the likelihood
  inference procedure (except via base frequencies), but the computational
  complexity of phylogenetic analyses grows with the number of sequences.
  </p>

  <p>
  Finally, Datamonkey may rename some of the sequences to conform to HyPhy naming
  conventions for technical reasons (all sequence names must be valid identifiers,
  e.g. they cannot contain spaces). This is done automatically and has no effect
  on the subsequent analyses.
  </p>

  <h3>Common issues</h3>

  <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger">
    <h4>Non-text files</h4>
    Datamonkey expects sequence alignments to be uploaded as text files. Any other
    format (Word, RTF, PDF) will not be recognized and must be converted into plain
    text prior to submission. 
  </div>

  <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger">
    <h4>Nonstandard characters in the alignment</h4>
    For instance, BioEdit may use the tilde ('~') character to denote a gap. The
    dot ('.') character is sometimes used as "match the first sequence" character
    and sometimes as the gap character. Datamonkey will accept 
    <a  href='http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/misc/naseq.html#300'>IUPAC nucleotide characters</a> (ACGT/U and ambiguity characters) and
    '?', 'X', 'N' or '-' for gap or missing data (Datamonkey is not case
    sensitive). All other characters in sequence data will be skipped and could
    result in frame shifts.
  </div>

  <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger">
    <h4>Uploading an amino-acid alignment</h4>
    Datamonkey employs codon models which require the knowledge of silent substitutions, lost upon translation to amino-acids. 
  </div>

  <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger">
    <h4>Termination codons</h4>
    Datamonkey will reject any alignments that contains stop codons, even if the
    stop codon is at the end of the sequence (i.e. is a proper termination codon).
    Please strip all stop codons out of the alignment prior to uploading it (the
    HyPhy standard analysis <tt>Data File Tools:CleanStopCodons.bf</tt> can do this
    by replacing all stop codons with indels).
  </div>

  <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger">
    <h4>Alignments that are too gappy</h4>
    If an alignment contains more than 50% of indels, it may not be properly
    processed (e.g. it could be read as a protein alignment, depending on the
    alignment format).
  </div>

  <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger">
    <h4>Alignments that are too large</h4>
    If your alignment exceeds the size currently allowed by Datamonkey, consider
    running your analysis locally in HyPhy.  A detailed discussion of how HyPhy can
    be used for that purpose can be found in <a
    href='http://www.hyphy.org/pubs/hyphybook2007.pdf' CLASS =
    'REFERENCE'>Selection using HyPhy</a>.
  </div>

  <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger">
    <h4>Incorrect genetic code</h4>
    If the genetic code is misspecified (e.g. the mitochondrial code is applied to
    nuclear sequences), valid alignments may fail to upload and if they do, then
    the results may be compromised (because codons are mistranslated). Make sure
    the correct genetic code is selected on the data upload page.
