             The codon-based maximum likelihood <a href="/help/IFEL.php" class="INFO" >IFEL</a> method

             population level (i.e. along internal branches). A discussion of the method and its application can be found

            Recombination leaves an imprint on sequence alignments: different segments of the alignment may be

            recombination in the alignment?", and <a href="/help/Recomb.php#GARD" class="INFO" >GARD</a>, that attempts to find all the recombination 
            breakpoints. Both method are described in this <a href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/23/10/1891" class="REFERENCE" >paper</a>. The output of GARD is accepted by most other analyses, and because recombination 
            can mislead phylogenetic analysis that do not account for it, we strongly urge that recombination testing be done on any alignment that is going to be
